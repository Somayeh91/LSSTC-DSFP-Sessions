    "Broadly speaking, machine-learning methods constitute a diverse collection of data-driven algorithms designed to classify/characterize/analyze sources in multi-dimensional spaces. The topics and studies that fall under the umbrella of machine learning is growing, and there is no good catch-all definition. The number (and variation) of algorithms is vast, and beyond the scope of these exercises. While we will discuss a few specific algorithms today, more importantly, we will explore the scope of the two general methods: unsupervised learning and supervised learning and introduce the powerful (and dangerous?) Python package [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",

    "At the most basic level, `scikit-learn` makes machine learning extremely easy within `python`. By way of example, here is a short piece of code that builds a complex, non-linear model to classify sources in the Iris data set that we learned about earlier:\n",

    "Those 4 lines of code have constructed a model that is superior to any system of hard cuts that we could have encoded while looking at the multidimensional space. This can be fast as well: execute the dummy code in the cell below to see how \"easy\" machine-learning is with `scikit-learn`."

    "Generally speaking, the procedure for `scikit-learn` is uniform across all machine-learning algorithms. Models are accessed via the various modules (`ensemble`, `SVM`, `neighbors`, etc), with user-defined tuning parameters. The features (or data) for the models are stored in a 2D array, `X`, with rows representing individual sources and columns representing the corresponding feature values. [In a minority of cases, `X`, represents a similarity or distance matrix where each entry represents the distance to every other source in the data set.] In cases where there is a known classification or scalar value (typically supervised methods), this information is stored in a 1D array `y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised models are fit by calling `.fit(X)` and supervised models are fit by calling `.fit(X, y)`. In both cases, predictions for new observations, `Xnew`, can be obtained by calling `.predict(Xnew)`. Those are the basics and beyond that, the details are algorithm specific, but the documentation for essentially everything within `scikit-learn` is excellent, so read the docs.\n",

    "## Problem 2) Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised machine learning, sometimes referred to as clustering or data mining, aims to group or classify sources in the multidimensional feature space. The \"unsupervised\" comes from the fact that there are no target labels provided to the algorithm, so the machine is asked to cluster the data \"on its own.\" The lack of labels means there is no (simple) method for validating the accuracy of the solution provided by the machine (though sometimes simple examination can show the results are **terrible**). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason [*note* - this is my (AAM) opinion and there many be many others who disagree], unsupervised methods are not particularly useful for astronomy. Supposing one did find some useful clustering structure, an adversarial researcher could always claim that the current feature space does not accurately capture the physics of the system and as such the clustering result is not interesting or, worse, erroneous. The one potentially powerful exception to this broad statement is outlier detection, which can be a branch of both unsupervised and supervised learning. Finding weirdo objects is an astronomical pastime, and there are unsupervised methods that may help in that regard in the LSST era. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin today we will examine one of the most famous, and simple, clustering algorithms: [$k$-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). $k$-means clustering looks to identify $k$ convex clusters, where $k$ is a user defined number. And here-in lies the rub: if we truly knew the number of clusters in advance, we likely wouldn't need to perform any clustering in the first place. This is the major downside to $k$-means. Operationally, pseudocode for the algorithm can be summarized as the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "    initiate search by identifying k points (i.e. the cluster centers)\n",
    "    loop \n",
    "        assign each point in the data set to the closest cluster center\n",
    "        calculate new cluster centers based on mean position of all points within cluster\n",
    "        if diff(new center - old center) < threshold:\n",
    "            stop (i.e. clusters are defined)\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold is defined by the user, though in some cases the total number of iterations is also. An advantage of $k$-means is that the solution will always converge, though the solution may only be a local minimum. Disadvantages include the assumption of convexity, i.e. difficult to capture complex geometry, and the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `scikit-learn` the [`KMeans`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans) algorithm is implemented as part of the [`sklearn.cluster`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster) module. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2a** Fit two different $k$-means models to the iris data, one with 2 clusters and one with 3 clusters. Plot the resulting clusters in the sepal length-sepal width plane (same plot as above). How do the results compare to the true classifications?"

In brief, `DBSCAN` requires two parameters: `minPts`, the minimum number of points necessary for a cluster, and $\\epsilon$, a distance measure. Clusters are grown by identifying *core points*, objects that have at least `minPts` located within a distance $\\epsilon$. *Reachable points* are those within a distance $\\epsilon$ of at least one *core point* but less than `minPts` *core points*. Identically, these points define the outskirts of the clusters. Finally, there are also *outliers* which are points that are $> \\epsilon$ away from any *core points*. Thus, `DBSCAN` naturally identifies clusters, does not assume clusters are convex, and even provides a notion of outliers. The downsides to the algorithm are that the results are highly dependent on the two tuning parameters, and that clusters of highly different densities can be difficult to recover (because $\\epsilon$ and `minPts` is specified for all clusters. \n",

Typically, though not always, distances between sources are Euclidean, and the final classification is assigned to whichever class has a plurality within the $k$ nearest neighbors (in the case of regression, the average of the $k$ neighbors is the output from the model).
